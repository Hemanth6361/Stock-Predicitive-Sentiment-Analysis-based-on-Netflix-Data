# Stock-Predicitive-Sentiment-Analysis-based-on-Netflix-Data

## Problem Statement
Stock exchange is a subject that is highly affected by economic, social, and political factors. There are several factors e.g. external factors or internal factors which can affect and move the stock market. Stock prices rise and fall every second due to variations in supply and demand. Various Data mining techniques are frequently involved to solve this problem. But techniques using machine learning will give a more accurate, precise and simple way to solve such issues related to stock and market prices. “Stock Price Prediction Using Twitter Sentiment Analysis” a method for predicting stock prices is developed using news articles. The changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company. Understanding people's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. Positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase. A prediction model for finding and analyzing correlation between contents of tweets and stock prices and then making predictions for future prices can be developed by using machine learning.  


In the last decade, sentiment analysis has carried great importance because of the huge amount of textual data on news and social media platforms. There is a signiﬁcant amount of research on mining opinions of users for different application areas. Ali performed sentiment analysis to detect transportation entities in the large corpus and to detect trafﬁc accidents to reduce serious injuries [43]. Basiri proposed a sentiment analysis method on the Twitter dataset using the attention-based bidirectional CNN-RNN deep model. Li proposed a bidirectional emotional recurrent unit for exploring the emotion in conversation. Using the same trend for stock prediction, some researchers have started to utilize sentiment analysis to analyze the stock market’s movements. In 2011, J. Bollen proposed a sentiment analysis method to predict the movement of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock market based on the famous microblogging site Twitter. Khatri and Srivastava explored the relationship between text sentiment from tweets, comments on the Stock Twist website, and the stock price of Facebook, Apple, Google, Oracle, and Microsoft stocks from Yahoo Finance. In 2017, Urolagin used an SVM classiﬁer to perform sentiment classiﬁcation and predict stock market status based on stock price data from Yahoo Finance and social-media data from Twitter. He explored an association between tweet features and the stock prices of a company. Not long after that, Chakraborty proposed a stock-market-movement prediction model based on tweets sentiment of NETFLIX stock. The SVM classiﬁer was used for sentiment classiﬁcation, while the stock movement prediction model was trained by applying the boosted regression tree. In 2020, Khan utilized algorithms on social media and ﬁnancial news data to discover the impact of both data on stock movement.
